    "Each day many incidents happen on the road network of the Netherlands. To minimize the consequences on other traffic, road inspectors are send to the locations of the incidents. To ensure good and safe traffic flow, it is important that the road inspectors reach the locations as fast as possible. For this the road inspectors need to be stationed at efficient places so all incidents locations can be reached as far as possible. Currently, the average travel time of a road inspector to an incident is 18 minutes. The goal of this assignment is to find locations to get a travel time lower than 18 minutes. \n",

    "This gives the following research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "***What are the optimum locations for road inspectors to reach incidents as fast as possible?***\n",
    "\n",
    "To help answer the question, there are several subquestions\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the best optimisation methods to locate the road inspectors to reach the incidents?\n",
    "* What kind of different scenarios could be classified? (e.g. peak hour situation)\n",
    "* How many inspectors should be introduced to the network in total to ensure that each incident has at least one inspector?\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this notebook will show the locations of inspectors we found and the process that brought us there. First, the data of the incidents is filtered and analysed. After that, data is collected about the speed and intensities of the road network, which is used ot determine the speed and travel times on each road section. After that the different algorithms are presented. The results of these algorithms are then validated and finally, the result and conclusions are shown. "
