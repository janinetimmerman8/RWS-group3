## Research questions
### Main research question
What are the optimum locations for road inspectors to reach incidents as fast as possible? 

### Sub questions
- What are the best optimisation methods to locate the road inspectors to reach the incidents?
- What kind of different scenarios could be classified?
- To what extent should the inspectors have fixed base locations or be moved around at different times?
- How many inspectors should be introduced to the network in total to ensure every incident has at least one inspector?


## Data
- Road incident data:
  - Types of incidents 
  - Starting time of incidents

- Road network data:
  - Shape files of road network
- Weather data
- Road inspector location data


## Tech stack
- Git
- Visual Studio
- Python
- Anaconda
- Data story / dashboard platform
